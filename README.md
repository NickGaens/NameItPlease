# NameItPlease
Demo app built when attending the session 'AI &amp; DL for developers'.

# Important!
In order to run the iOS app as-is, use the included Jupyter notebook to generate both 'resnet50.mlmodel' and 'vgg16.mlmodel'. These files are ±110MB and ±550MB in size and are therefor not part of this repository. Next, simply copy these files to the models-directory and build + run the app using Xcode.

# Note
This app will only run on a physical device; iOS Simulator is not supported and will probably cause an app crash during startup.
